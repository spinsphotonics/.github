# Welcome to [SPINS Photonics](spinsphotonics.com) ðŸ’«

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ We're [Jesse](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zYN5iqMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Jelena](http://web.stanford.edu/~jela/),
and [SPINS Photonics](spinsphotonics.com) is our little attempt to **revolutionize photonics** ðŸ¤“.

We believe that all that we need to do is to *enable photonic designers to harness compute at scale*.

We're starting with [fdtd-z](https://github.com/spinsphotonics/fdtdz). Go check it out!
