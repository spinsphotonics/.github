# Welcome to [SPINS Photonics](spinsphotonics.com)

Hi! At SPINS ðŸ’« we're building the computational tools needed to enable massive breakthroughs in photonic design.
Our goal is to revolutionize what photonic circuits, imaging lenses, lithography masks (and more!) are capable of.
We believe this will be possible once photonic designers are able to harness compute at scale. 

To this end, we're building:

* **fdtd-z** (coming soon): a fast, scalable, and accessible photonic simulation engine
