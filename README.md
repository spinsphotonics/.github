# Welcome to [SPINS Photonics](spinsphotonics.com)

Hi! At SPINS ðŸ’« we're building the computational tools needed to enable massive breakthroughs in photonic design.
Our goal is to revolutionize photonic integrated circuits, imaging lenses, lithography masks (and more!)
by enabling photonic designers to harness compute at scale. 

We're starting by laying the foundation with **fdtd-z** (coming soon) and building out from there.
